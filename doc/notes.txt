2017-02-19 - Upgradable locks
-----------------------------


Principle
---------

When dealing with complex structures such as trees, maintaining a write lock
on a tree during write operations is expensive because most of the time is
spent looking up the entry to modify and very little time is spent modifying
the entry, so during this time no read operation may be performed.

The "upgradable" lock tries to address this issue by having 5 levels of locking
for a shared resource :

  - unlocked                (or UL)
  - read-only shared access (or RS for read shared)
  - seek access             (or MS for modify shared, indicating a write intent)
  - exclusive write access  (or WX for write exclusive)
  - an atomic write access  (or WA for write atomic)

The rights and expectations these locks impose to their users are the
following :
  - unlocked
    - owner may not access the protected structure at all.
    - owner may attempt to take any lock
    - others may do what they want with it
    - others may take any lock

  - read-shared
    - owner may read any location from the protected structure without any
      requirement for ordering ;
    - owner must wait for writers to leave before being granted the lock
    - others may take a read lock or a modify-shared lock
    - others may read any location from the protected structure without any
      requirement for ordering ;
    - others may take any form of write lock but will first have to wait for
      readers to leave before proceeding with writes ;

  - seek-shared
    - owner may read any location from the protected structure without any
      requirement for ordering ;
    - owner must wait for writers and for other seekers to leave before being
      granted the lock ;
    - owner may upgrade the lock to a write lock at any instant without prior
      notification ;
    - owner must wait for readers to leave after the lock is upgraded before
      performing any write ;
    - owner may release the lock without performing an upgrade ;
    - owner may also downgrade the lock to a read-shared lock ;
    - others may take a read lock only
    - others may read any location from the protected structure without any
      requirement for ordering ;

  - write-exclusive
    - owner must wait for writers and for seekers to leave before being granted
      the lock (this is guaranted when upgrading from seek-shared) ;
    - owner must wait for readers to leave after the lock is granted before
      performing any write ;
    - owner may perform any modification to the protected structure ;
    - owner may downgrade the lock to a modify-shared lock ;
    - owner may downgrade the lock to a read-shared lock ;
    - others may not take any lock ;
    - others may not access the protected structure at all ;

  - write-atomic
    - owner must wait for writers and for seekers to leave before being
      granted the lock, but doesn't exclude other write-atomic users ;
    - owner must wait for readers to leave after the lock is granted before
      performing any write ;
    - owner must be very careful during reads so that any supported atomic
      operation has no functional impact on its access (may detect the change
      and perform a retry) ;
    - owner may only carefully apply modifications to the protected structure
      using atomic operations and memory barriers in a way that is compatible
      with its own usage ;
    - others may only hold the same write-atomic lock
    - others may only carefully apply modifications to the protected structure
      using atomic operations and memory barriers in a way that is compatible
      with others' usage ;
    - the protections involved with this type of lock are 100% application
      specific. Most commonly this will be used to remove an element from a
      list using atomic operations and all compatible functions will use this
      lock instead of any of the 3 above.

The upgradable read access is an intermediary state between the read only
shared access and the write access. It is used only during the seeking phase
necessary to locate the place to perform some changes. It allows other regular
readers to access the resource. Once the resource is located, it is turned into
an exclusive write access, and once all readers are gone, the change can be
performed. Due to its nature, this lock's "upgradability" is guaranted by
design. This rule implies that this type of lock is exclusive against itself,
which means that it is not allowed for two writers to use this one at the same
time (otherwise the structure of the tree may become inconsistent across the
lock).

The compatiblity matrix looks like this for any two threads :

                      thread 1

                | UL | RS | MS | WX  | WA
           -----+----+----+----+-----+-----
             UL |  X |  X |  X |  X  |  X
           -----+----+----+----+-----+-----
             RS |  X |  X |  X |     |
  thread 2 -----+----+----+----+-----+-----
             MS |  X |  X |    |     |
           -----+----+----+----+-----+-----
             WX |  X |    |    |     |
           -----+----+----+----+-----+-----
             WA |  X |    |    |     |  X
           -----+----+----+----+-----+-----


The S and A locks are very special in that they are not fully exclusive :


             Concurrent accesses allowed
  Current
  state   |   U  |   R  |   S  |   W  |   A
     -----+------+------+------+------+-------
       U  | 0..N | 0..N | 0..1 | 0..1 | 0..N
     -----+------+------+------+------+-------
       R  | 0..N | 0..N | 0..1 |   0  |   0
     -----+------+------+------+------+-------
       S  | 0..N | 0..N |   0  |   0  |   0
     -----+------+------+------+------+-------
       W  | 0..N |   0  |   0  |   0  |   0
     -----+------+------+------+------+-------
       A  | 0..N |   0  |   0  |   0  | 0..N
     -----+------+------+------+------+-------


Note: it's still hard to find short names which unambiguously match the various
      use cases :
        - the read-only access may be qualified as "Shared Read", "Read Only",
          "Shared Access", "Read Lookup", "Read Traversal", "Read Lock" ;

        - the upgradable shared access may be qualified as "Write Traversal",
          "Write Lookup", "Write Request", "Shared Write", "Pending Write",
          "Write Intent", "Partially Locked", "Read Modify", "Modify Access",
          "Limited Access", "Reserved Access", "Seek Access" ;

        - the exclusive write access may be qualified as "Exclusive Write",
          "Write Commit", "Write Access", "Exclusive Access", "Write Lock" ;

        - the atomic write access may be qualified as "Delete", "Unlink",
          "Shared Write" ;

It could also be easier to consider states 0 to 3 for unlocked to exclusively
locked.

In practice, it is useful to understand all states including the transient ones
as shown below :

    W   M   R   State
  ----+---+---+------------
    0 | 0 | 0 | Unlocked
    0 | 0 |>0 | Shared access
    0 | 1 |>1 | Limited access
    0 |>1 | X | Limited access, conflict (transient)
    1 | 0 |>1 | Exclusive write access requested
    1 | 0 | 1 | Exclusive write access granted
    1 | 0 |>0 | Atomic write access requested
    1 | 0 | 0 | Atomic write access granted


Implementation
--------------

In terms of implementation, these states are turned into "no more XXX" bits :

  - RS = "no more writes"
  - MS = "no more modifications nor writes"
  - WX = "no more accesses"
  - WA = "no more non-atomic accesses"

Thus the resource is effectively locked in a given state after the condition
is realized. So there is always a transition period between one state and
another during which the caller of the lock has to wait for the condition to
be satisfied, as could be translated in the pseudo language below, describing
some atomic sequences of operations :

   lock_rs() {
      wait_for_no_more_writer();
      inc_reader_count();
   }

   lock_ms() {
      wait_for_no_more_writer_nor_modifier();
      inc_modifier_count();
   }

   lock_wx() {
      inc_modifier_count();
      wait_for_no_more_access();
   }

These operations can be performed using atomic additions into a single integer
holding rs_count, ms_count and wx_count, provided that the current state is
known :

  - lock_ul_to_rs <=> lock += rs_lock;
  - lock_ul_to_ms <=> lock += ms_lock;
  - lock_ul_to_wx <=> lock += wx_lock;
  - lock_ms_to_wx <=> lock += wx_lock - ms_lock;
  - unlock_rs     <=> lock -= rs_lock;
  - unlock_ms     <=> lock -= ms_lock;
  - unlock_wx     <=> lock -= wx_lock;

And the resulting value of the lock immediately allows to check for users in
multiple classes at once.

Note, there's no prerequisite that the upgraded lock has the same value as a
simple exclusive lock. Actually both of them may easily coexist if that's
easier to deal with. Depending on the architecture it might be easier to test
some bits at once, and on other architectures it might be preferable to take
multiple bitfields at once (eg: wx could have rs, ms and wx at the same time).
For this reason it might be reasonable not to consider that an upgraded lock
is the same as a pure write lock so that applications take care of using the
appropriate unlock method.

For instance, considering that wx takes ms and rs, we could have :

  lock_wx() <=> lock += wx_lock + ms_lock + rs_lock.

Testing for unicity here is simple, it consists in checking for any rs_lock
value greater than 1, which is still compatible with the use of a bit field.
For example if there are 16 bits for the rs_lock, testing for > 1 is equivalent
to testing for >= 2, which is testing against mask 0xfffe.

In this case the rs_lock counter could in fact be seen as a user counter or a
visitor counter.

One difficulty with 3 fields like this is that for any given lock counter, it
has to be divided in 3 equal parts. For 30 bits, it leaves only 10 bits per
part, implying only 1023 users. For 62 bits, it's 20 bits per part, or 1048575
users. One point is that while there may be many concurrent readers, there will
only be some concurrent attempts to read and some concurrent attempts to write,
unless we make it mandatory to request a write before upgrading it. In practice
only one writer will be present at most, so one bit should be enough, but since
it would require two operations that's not optimal. And we can't accept the
risk of an overflow on the write part because during a check it would let some
readers pass through in the middle of a write operation.

However we can in shrink the number of write request bits. Indeed, we have only
one at once except during attempts to get a write access. But if we have an
overflow on the write request part, then it leaks into the writers part and
still maintains the tree protected against any other access. The only side
effect of such an overflow is that it may temporarily deny access to a pure
reader for the time it takes to revert the operation, but it never attacks the
tree's integrity. So we just need to minimize this probability for performance
purposes. Tests show that using 2 bits here achieves 3% better performance under
stress (50% read-only, 50% read-update) than a single bit, and the performance
doesn't increase when going above. With 2 bits we can have up to 3 concurrent
threads trying to grab the lock without locking reads, so that should be more
than enough.

Example with 30 bits :

  - 31..18 : 14 bits for writers
  - 17..16 : 2  bits for write requesters
  - 16..2  : 14 bits for users

=> up to 13107 writers in the tree or 16383 readers.

With 62 bits :

  - 30 bits for writers
  - 2  bits for requesters
  - 30 bits for users
  => ~850M writers, ~1.07B readers

or :

  - 28 bits for writers
  - 6  bits for requesters
  - 28 bits for users
  => 264 million writers, 268 million readers

It might be possible to make the number of bits in the middle configurable so
that depending on the write-to-read ratio we can further limit the risk of
collisions, or instead increase the ability to support larger thread counts.
For example having 0 bits for write requesters in the 30-bit design allows up
to 32767 threads to coexist. And similarly, any count above this turns the
operation into an apparent write access due to users bit leaking into the
writers bits, causing the operation to be reverted.

The list of possible transitions follows :

  - unlocked ---> shared access

      lock_ul_to_shared() {
        while (xadd(lock, R) & W) {
          xadd(lock, -R);
          while (lock & W)
            pause();
        }
      }

      lock_ul_to_limited() {
        while (xadd(lock, M|R) & (M|W)) {
          xadd(lock, -(M|R));
          while (lock & (M|W))
            pause();
        }
      }

      lock_ul_to_exclusive() {
        while (xadd(lock, W|M|R) & W) {
          xadd(lock, -(W|M|R));
          while (lock & W)
            pause();
        }
        while (lock & R & -2)
          pause();
      }

      lock_lim_to_exclusive() {
        while (xadd(lock, W) & W) {
          xadd(lock, -W);
          while (lock & W)
            pause();
        }
        while (lock & R & -2)
          pause();
      }

      lock_shr_to_exclusive() {
        while (xadd(lock, W|M) & W) {
          xadd(lock, -(W|M));
          while (lock & W)
            pause();
        }
        while (lock & R & -2)
          pause();
      }


Application
-----------

A typical use case is for ebtrees in order to secure the following operations :
  - node *insert(tree, node) : insert node <node> into tree <tree>, return
                               <node> or another one if unique bit is set
  - node *lookup(tree, key)  : lookup value <key> in tree <tree>, return the
                               first matching node or NULL
  - node *delete(tree, node) : delete node <node> from tree <tree>. Returns the
                               node if properly deleted or NULL if the node was
                               not there.
  - node *pick(tree, key)    : lookup value <key> in tree <tree>, detach it from
                               the tree and return it, or return NULL if not
                               found.

Implementation :
  - insert(tree, node) {
        lock_ms(tree);
        walk_down_to(node->key);
        lock_ms_to_wx(tree);
        insert_node_here(node);
        unlock_wx(tree);
    }

  - lookup(tree, key) {
        lock_rs(tree);
        walk_down_to(key);
        unlock_rs(tree);
    }

  - delete(tree, node) {
        lock_wx(tree);
        delete_node(node);
        unlock_wx(tree);
    }

  - pick(tree, key) {
        lock_ms(tree);
        walk_down_to(key);
        lock_ms_to_wx(tree);
        delete_node(node);
        unlock_wx(tree);
    }

For some applications like a scheduler, all operations will be either pick() or
insert(). All of them will be exclusive between each other. For each entry,
there will be exactly one insert() and one pick(). The pick() operation here is
problematic as it will serialize all accesses. An alternative approach consists
in retryable lookups + deletes :

   do {
      node = lookup_next(tree);
   } while (node && !delete(tree, node));

This will also ensure atomicity during the pick up period while not locking the
whole tree during the descent. And since the lookup() is compatible with the
lock_ms() used during the descent for the insert() operation, most operations
can be performed in parallel.

Some operations may be performed in multiple steps without completely unlocking
the tree. For example in order to use lookup_next(), it might be required that
the previous element is returned with the tree still locked. But depending on
what is supposed to be performed, different types of locks might be needed.
For example, in order to only dump a tree, it is sufficient to lock the tree
read_only and jump between nodes using lookup_next(). However in order to
perform a two-step lookup+update as above, it is mandatory to leave the tree
in an upgradable locked state in order to guarantee that no other subsequent
modification will be performed nor could block. Last, a complete cleanup of a
tree could consist in looking up the first element, locking the tree for writes
and performing deletes alternating with lookup_next().

For this reason it appears that some operations are relative to existing nodes
and do not affect the locking at all :
  - lookup_next()
  - lookup_prev()

It's the caller's responsibility to ensure that the initial node is valid and
that these functions are used with appropriate locking.

Then there are some lookup functions applying to the tree :

  - lookup_first(), lookup_last()
  - lookup_key(), ...

These functions may leave the tree in locked read or locked modified state.

Then some functions modify the tree and may leave it in a still modifiable
state because the write lock has not yet been released ("uncommitted" ?) :

  - pick(), insert(), delete()


Data protection
---------------

The method described here only applies to the tree structure, but doesn't
prevent data from being modified or even released during the lookups. It is
important to distinguish two things :

  - the tree structure (linking between nodes)
  - the data integrity (no use-after-free etc)

The tree is made of nodes linked together, and the locking ensures that no node
is visited during a tree traversal after being removed from the tree. Thus from
a tree structure perspective it is safe to free a node that was deleted from
the tree. However that doesn't mean that there's no other user of this node, eg
consecutive to a successful lookup operation, so it is up to the application to
ensure proper refcounting on the data.

A typical lookup_next() operation cannot be performed on a node that was
removed by another user, regardless of the fact that it has not necessarily
been freed. And conversely it's not acceptable to leave a node in the tree
waiting for its refcount to be zeroed before being deleted. If a lookup_next()
operation has to be used, then it looks like a reasonable expectation that the
previous lookup leaves the tree locked against modifications.

It does not seem necessary to implement any form of refcounting between the
tree and the data stored in the tree. While the tree structure relies on the
nodes themselves, there is no reason for any access to the tree to be done in
a "degraded" mode where the tree is inconsistent. Thus if all tree access
operations remain valid, it's up to the application to add proper refcounting
to its data nodes upon lookups to avoid the risk of concurrent use and removal.

A typical set of "get", "put", "del" operations could be implemented like this :

   node *get_key(tree, key) {
       node = lookup_locked(tree, key);
       if (node)
           node->refcount++;
       unlock_tree(tree);
       return node:
   }

   put_node(node) {
       node->refcount--;
   }

   del_node(tree, node) {
       delete_node(tree, node);
   }

It *may* make sense to decide that a node stored in the tree has 1 added to its
refcount but that's only a matter of implementation choice as nothing makes
this a necessity :

   node *get_key(tree, key) {
       node = lookup_locked(tree, key);
       if (node)
           node->refcount++;
       unlock_tree(tree);
       return node:
   }

   put_node(node) {
       if (!node->refcount--)
          free(node);
   }

   del_node(tree, node) {
       delete_node(tree, node);
       if (!node->refcount--)
          free(node);
   }
